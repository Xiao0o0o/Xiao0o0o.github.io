Hello everyone! I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Arizona State University (ASU), working under the supervision of Professor [Hua Wei](https://www.public.asu.edu/~hwei27/index.html). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Beijing Jiaotong University and my Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia (UBC), Okanagan Campus, under the guidance of Professor [Yong Gao](https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/yongg/).

I am still in the process of exploring my research direction. My current interests lie in the Trustworthy Graph Neural Networks and various graph-based applications. If you have similar research interests, Iâ€™d be happy to connect and discuss ideas!
