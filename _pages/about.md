Hello! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Arizona State University (ASU), working under the supervision of Professor [Hua Wei](https://www.public.asu.edu/~hwei27/index.html). Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Beijing Jiaotong University and my Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia (UBC), Okanagan Campus, under the guidance of Professor [Yong Gao](https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/yongg/).

## Research Interests
======

My research focuses on trustworthy AI with an emphasis on uncertainty quantification, explainability, and graph-based learning.

- Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models (LLMs): Studying and evaluating different UQ methods in LLMs, with a current focus on analyzing uncertainty in reasoning processes through graph-based representations.

- Explainability in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): Designing methods to assess and improve the reliability of GNN explanations.

## Publications
